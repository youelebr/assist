**Introduction**

The purpose of ASSIST (Automatic Source-to-Source assISTant) is to provide a semi automatic tool to perform source-to-source transformations to optimize performances. ASSIST is based on the Rose Compiler Framework Project and uses its API to read and modify the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by Roseâ€™s compiler frontends. Source of Rose can be download on this github; it is based on an older version but with a lot of bug fix.

ASSIST is currently consider as a semi automatic tool because it requires the intervention of the user. He has multiple ways to guide ASSIST: directive can be added in the source code to guide the transformations on specific part of the code; ASSIST can also be directly feed with results from MAQAO modules such as Oneview, CQA, or VPROF.

ASSIST allows to easily performing complex modifications in order to carry out:
* Performance optimization
* General program transformation
* Instrumentation
* Perform optimizations using MAQAO analyses

**Compilation**
ASSIST is part of the MAQAO tool suite. Maqao can be download here: https://git.maqao.org/MAQAO/MAQAO 
The ASSIST directory must be in MAQAO/src/plugins/ and named s2s, then you must follow MAQAO compilation steps.

**ASSIST use**
A pdf tutorial is provide with ASSIST.

**ASSIST command**
There are several ways to perform source-to-source transformations using ASSIST.

To trigger transformations using specific directives previsouly inserted in a specific source file:
*maqao s2s -option="apply-directives" -src=toto.c*

To use the Oneview report generated for ASSIST and trigger transformations using specific directives:
*maqao s2s -oneview=assist.lua -option="apply-directives"*

More options are describe in the help of the module.
*maqao s2s -help*

**ASSIST Directives**
All available directives are list and detailed in the pdf user document.
